There were also several individuals we interviewed who felt that to talk about the news meant inevitably talking about politics, and thus felt hesitant to engage on news topics with family members who were more liberal or conservative than they were. With this information in mind, my team and I sought to identify an artifact that would create opportunities for family members to discuss news stories with each other, while at the same time allowing them to avoid talking about politics should they wish to. After much ideation and discussion we came up with several ideas (including several board game possibilities), but ultimately decided on creating a smart phone application; a major factor in that decision was that we wanted the artifact to be usable for families that weren’t living in a single household.  Our most important goal for the app was helping build connection, in as inclusive a way as possible, and thus we opted for the type of artifact that we felt would encompass the greatest variety of family situations. During the design process for the app, when making decisions, we continued to return to that core value of connection, ensuring that every “feature” we included was supportive of it. Once I had completed our paper prototype for usability testing, we also made sure to include questions for our testers regarding how using the various features would make them feel more or less connected to family members, and what additional could be done to support that connectedness. While making and testing the paper prototype marked the end of my group’s assignment, I am hoping to continue iterating on the prototype based on user testing and eventually actually build the app (stay tuned!).</p></div></div></div><hr/><div id="kidsteam"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><h2>Kids Team SPL</h2><h3>Context</h3><p>KidsTeam SPL (Seattle Public Library) is an intergenerational co-design team of children (ages 7 – 12) and design researchers in public library settings.  It is a collaboration between the Seattle Public Library, researchers at UW’s iSchool, and the non-profit organization Foundry 10. Its current goal is to use participatory design as a tool for learning how to integrate digital games into successful storytelling activities for children.</p><h3>Role</h3><p>For the fall quarter of 2017, I was a graduate student member of KidsTeam SPL’s research team. I served as an adult co-designer during the weekly co-design sessions, designed and led one of the sessions (with a team of three others), and analyzed and coded the data collected from the seven sessions in order to create design recommendations related to digital games and storytelling activities. </p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ol><li>Identified strategies with which digital games can be incorporated into storytelling activities with youth.</li><li>Used co-design as a technique for generating insight and feedback from youth and adults regarding story creation, game play, and game design.</li><li>Learned how to successfully lead and participate in participatory design activities with youth.</li></ol><h3>Project Rundown</h3><p>Participatory Design in Libraries is a new course in UW’s iSchool, that blends classroom learning with real world design and research. Through this course I was able to attend weekly classroom sessions focused on learning about the theory behind participatory design, as well as be an adult participant in KidsTeam SPL.</p><p>For KidsTeam SPL, each week, our team of adult designers/researchers came to the Columbia City Branch of the Seattle Public library to lead and participate in co-design sessions with a group of 15 children, ages 7-11. The design activity of each co-design session was created and led by several members of our team (rotating each week) and would focus on answering a specific design question (e.g. What’s the role of the library in helping kids create stories in video games?).  Participatory design methods such as Stickies and Mixing Ideas, were used in these activities in order to generate, record, and organize feedback from participants.  The end of each session would also always include a guided discussion time, in which the adult researchers/designers would use leading questions to elicit feedback and insights from the participants.</p><p>For all design sessions, our team utilized multiple methods of recording data. All sessions were video recorded, photographs were taken throughout each session, and after each session, analytic memos were written by the graduate student members of the team. Once we had reached the end of the fall session of KidsTeam SPL, myself and the other graduate students then went through and analyzed and coded all of the collected data. From what we learned through our analysis of the data (and our own experiences as participants in the co-design sessions), we were then able to write up design recommendations for SPL’s librarians for creation of storytime activities that integrate the use of digital games.</p><h3>Reflection</h3><p>I truly loved my experience as a member of KidsTeam SPL and the Participatory Design course. For me, it struck a nearly perfect balance between theoretical and hands-on learning, and allowed me to gain a much deeper understanding of an important design and research technique that I was previously unfamiliar with. It also allowed me to reflect upon my previous work experiences and understand how much more valuable the outcomes of certain projects would have been, if I had thought to integrate the end user in the design process itself.</p><p>My goal when enrolling at the iSchool was to enter an environment that would allow me to achieve the breadth and depth of experience that would not be possible in a non-academic context. I want to learn not just the tools and skills necessary for creating meaningful user experiences, I want to be able to understand, analyze, and critique the theories that are behind them.  This course combined with my participation in KidsTeam SPL allowed me to do both.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(-1deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/kidsteam.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Kids Team in Action</p></div><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(0deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/kidsteam-reflect-1.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Affinity Diagram</p></div><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(-3deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/kidsteam-reflect-2.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Affinity Diagramming</p></div><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(3deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/kidsteam-reflect-3.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Design Ideas from the Kids</p></div></div></div></div><hr/><div id="ancestry"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h2>IMPACT OF DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER GENETIC ANCESTRY TESTING RESULTS</h2><h3>Context</h3><p>As the final research project for my Research, Assessment, and Design course, my team and I investigated the impact direct-to-consumer genetic ancestry testing results have on individuals’ perception of their ethnic identity and belonging.</p><h3>Role</h3><p>My research group worked together as a team to:</p><ul><li>Solidify our research question and strategize our approach</li><li>Design and implement survey questionnaires, interviews, and document analyses</li><li>Analyze and code the data</li><li>Summarize and present our findings</li><li>Create a workshop for college students inspired by the findings from our research</li></ul><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ol><li>Gained experience in writing survey and interview questions to generate usable and meaningful data.</li><li>Used coding and analysis of data to identify important themes within our results.</li><li>Through the design of the workshop, created an effective way of communicating the most significant and relevant findings from our research project.</li></ol><h3>Project Rundown</h3><p>In order to answer to try and answer our research question of “How do the results of direct-to-consumer genetic ancestry testing impact individuals’ perceptions of their ethnic identity and belonging?”, our team identified three data collection instruments that we felt would work best to provide us with substantive and measurable data on participants’ experiences with genetic ancestry testing.  We created a 17-question online survey using Google Forms. The questions focused on the participant’s belief in and connection to their ethnic identity before the test, their test results and how they affected them, as well as their knowledge of genetic ancestry testing as a whole. We used a variety of question formats including multiple choice, check boxes, and scale.  The only questions with a short answer format were those pertaining to the participant’s description of their belief in their ethnicity before the test and the details of their test results, as we felt that no other format would be able to capture the nuances within these answers.  We were also especially careful with word choice and usage in our questions regarding ethnicity and identity, as we wanted to be sure that we would not alienate or offend any of the participants.</p><p>We easily determined that interviews would be an integral way for us to gather rich qualitative data regarding individuals’ experiences with genetic ancestry testing. For our interviews, we opted to use a standardized, open-ended format. Our questions mirrored those of the survey, but allowed for and encouraged elaboration upon their responses. We determined that a third data collection instrument would be useful for triangulation of our data, and thus chose to do document analyses of YouTube videos of individuals opening their genetic ancestry testing results online. We created a rubric for evaluating the videos, focusing on such areas as: their inspiration for taking the test, expectations of their results, and their emotional reaction to their results.</p><p>A limited timeline for collecting our data made it impossible for us to have a large enough pool of participants to generate any type of true representative sample.  For our surveys, we used our networks (social media, friends, colleagues) to distribute them to as diverse a group as possible. For our interviews and document analyses, we made sure to choose both male and female participants and ones with differing (perceived) ethnic backgrounds.  While our overall sample size was small (36 survey respondents, 6 interviews, 20 videos analyzed), from our data we were able to identify some very interesting themes. This included a low impact of genetic ancestry testing results on ethnic identity and the most most common emotional responses to results being “surprised” or “happy”. Our data also showed us that general curiosity was the most popular reason.</p><h3>Reflection</h3><p>My team’s research project was inspired by my literature review of the impact of genetic ancestry testing results. It is a topic that I have been incredibly interested in, ever since receiving my own test results from 23andMe over a year ago. My results were very surprising, and led me to question much of what I had previously taken for granted regarding my ethnic identity. I had used the literature review as an opportunity to learn more about what research has been done regarding how these ancestry testing services are affecting individuals, but found that very few studies have been done. As these genetic testing services are becoming increasingly popular and commonplace, I felt that it was important that more research be done regarding their impact. While my team’s research was for a class project and was conducted on a very small scale, I hope to pursue this research area further during my time as a graduate student. In the future, I would like to focus more specifically on how the effects of results differ depending on the way in which the information is presented to an individual.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(3deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/ancestry-1.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Survey Results</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(1deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/ancestry-2.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Survey Results</p></div></div></div></div><hr/><div id="personalProjects"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h2>Personal Projects</h2></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><div style="background:white;display:inline;float:left;margin:0 15px 30px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.3);transition:all 3s linear;z-index:0;position:relative;transform:rotate(0deg)"><img style="margin-top:20px;max-width:80%;border:1px solid #021a40" src="/static/images/scoreboardguru.png"/><p style="color:#333;font-size:20px;position:relative;top:5px">Scoreboard Guru App</p></div></div><div class="col-md-8"><h3>Scoreboard Guru</h3><p>My partner and I love playing card games, especially when traveling.
