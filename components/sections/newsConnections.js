            <h2>News Connections App Prototype</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>As the final research project for my Design Methods course, the two other members of my team and I went through the iterative process of creating an artifact that facilitates news discussion with family members.</p>

            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>I partnered with my team members on the interview, ideation, and user testing processes. I was solely responsible for creation of the wireframes and final visual design for the paper prototype of the application.</p>

            <h3>The Design Process</h3>
            <ol>
              <li> Went through a semi-structured interview process with stakeholders in order to determine their underlying needs and desires regarding communicating with family members about the news.</li>
              <li> Coded the data from the interviews and arranged into themes.</li>
              <li> Developed three personas in order to represent the themes found in the interview data.</li>
              <li> Went through several idea generation sessions in order to develop an artifact (a smartphone application) that would best serve to meet the underlying needs uncovered in the interview process. </li>
              <li> Sketched out the key features of the app, focusing on the most important elements for users.</li>
              <li> Used Adobe Illustrator to create wireframes of the app and eventually a low-fidelity paper prototype.</li>
              <li> Went through a usability testing process with multiple users, noting task success, errors, and general feedback.</li>
              <li> Used the data collected from the usability testing process to create a plan for future iterations of the prototype.</li>

            </ol>
