# Christina's Website

## Development
* You can run a local server with `npm start`
  * You will need homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
  * You will need node.js installed (`brew install node`)
  * You will need to install the dependancies for the project `npm install`

Running the command will tell you how to look at the site

## Deployment
* Just `git push`.  The site is served by Github.com's static site hosting
